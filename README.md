# Safe Loan

## Overview

📃 Safe Loan is a smart contract created in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. Its function is to record the information of a loan between two users (lender and borrower). 

🔒 Implementing a smart contract for your loan ensures that you have the support of the blockchain as a method of storing confidential information, which is not exposed to manipulation and will always be available to consult in case of non-compliance by any of the users mentioned in this contract. 

⚠️ Disclaimer: The function of this smart contract is only to create a backup of the information of both users involved in the loan. In no way will any retention or deduction be made on the assets of either of them as a guarantee method.
